# OIBSIB_Task3
Oasis internship, data science task no. 3

I have performed the basic concepts of ML and imported modules, read the csv files, checked if the dataset contains any missing values, performed correlation between the features of the dataset, done data visualization using seaborn and predicted the price using the decision tree.
